# segmentation_using_different_clustering_approaches--company_project

In this project, segmentation was applied to an important feature. Segments were used as input to main algorithms and increased efficiency of the production models. Several clustering approaches were used combining techniques below:

-PCA
-FAMD
-KMeans
-KPrototypes
-Spectral Clustering
-Dendongram
-Agglomerative Clustering
-HDBScan
